# Bikesharing

## Purpose of Analysis

This project is an analysis of New York Citi Sharing Bike data. We are creating a set of visualizations to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
